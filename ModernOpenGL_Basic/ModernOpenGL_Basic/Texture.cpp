    //the level helps to reduce filtering type effects, it is another technique to do minification and magnification. help to get the texture apprearing as crisp as it can. zero is the default level.
    //internal_format is how openGL is going to store the indivual pixels in the gpu, and tell it how to format them, RGBA means it is going to store the red, green, blue and alpha parts of the data
    //width and height are the size of the texture
    //border is set to zero by default, this is to add borders to your texture, meaning border lines
    //the format is the type of format of the data you are sending to the gpu, and the format here is an RGBA format
    //as for the type, this is actually the data type that you are sending in, meaning that you are telling openGL how the data is sorted, which in this case we are using BYTE

    //openGL does all texture location by coordinates from zero to one (0 -> 1), zero being left of the texture and one to the right on x axis and zero being the bottom of the texture and one being the top on y axis. that way it is resolution inderpendent. so this means you can specify a texture of any resolution.
    //so a uniform sampler is the type of variable that is updated by the gpu which you can use to specify texture coordinates, this is a variable that both the gpu and the cpu have access to. a sampler in openGL is the type of data that a texture has or takes, or which you use to pass in texture data. the gpu reads this in the fragment shader
